# indstat

The package provides utilities, examples, data sets and other materials related to the UNIDO INDSTAT database.

## Installation/Building from source

To install the latest stable development version from GitHub, you can
pull this repository and install it using

    ## install.packages("remotes")
    remotes::install_github("valentint/indstat")

Of course, if you have already installed `remotes`, you can skip the
first line (I have commented it out).

## Example

This is a simple example which shows you basic functions of the package. 

```{r example}
library(indstat)
getCountryCode("Austria")
getCountryCodeISO3("Austria")
getCountryName(c(156, 100, 512))

```
